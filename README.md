# `FLASHCARD GENERATOR`

## `Project Description`

This project assignment from Almabetter serves as a front-end capstone task.
It involves developing a flashcard generator application that facilitates the creation of multiple flashcards within a group.
This application offers features such as `card creation`, `the addition of both text and images`, `sharing`, `downloading`, `deletion`, and even the option to print the generated flashcards.
The user interface of this app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.

This Project Consists of 3 main pages:

1. ### `Create New Page`

   Here, a new card group is generated by completing all the necessary information and selecting the "create" option.
